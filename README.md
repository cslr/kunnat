D-Wave's Quantum Optimization Using Municipalities Statistics and Average Income (DQM model)

Attempt to use Municipalities data to learn which budgets give highest income from the population (through taxation).

RESULTS:

Nothing surprising. Biggest values in each variable (divided by the number of residents) result to highest income per resident. Data from Finnish Statistics Center (small dataset).
